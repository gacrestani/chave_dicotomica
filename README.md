# dichotomousKey 1.0.0
An HTML, JavaScript, and CSS app to navigate through a dichotomous key.

To run the app, simply go to [`app.html`](https://gacrestani.github.io/).

The app is responsive and prints a single line from the key to the user. The user then chooses which option to take. The app writes the path to a list that may be retrieved by the user later. By reaching a result, the user sees the main Wikipedia image for the group, which links to the respective Wikipedia page.
